# Greenland

Greenland is a tree planting registration system that records the trees planted
in an area alongside with their statuses.

In the traditional way, keeping track of the planted trees in most cases
involves the troublesome physical filing system. Hence, this tree planting
registration system aims to save time as well as to ease the process of querying
for treesâ€™ information. All in all, the main goal of our project is to build a
system that helps clients to register trees easily and retrieve information
regarding them from a server.

## Requirements

- Linux
- Make
- GCC
- Doxygen
- Astyle
- Check (unit testing)

## Building

To build the project, just run `make make`, and an executable binary file called
`greenland_client` and `greenland_server` will appear in the filesystem. Run it
with `./greenland_client` and `./greenland_server`.

Or to install in onto the system, you could run `make install` and call
`greenland_client` and `greenland_server` afterwards.
